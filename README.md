# This is a static website i created. My brother helped me out with the Javascript for the most part.
Created the index.html file and uploaded it to AWS S3 bucket( with public read only). A video of my dog Daisy is also stored on AWS S3 and the bucket object url for the video is refrenced in the Javascript as a source.
I went ahead and created a cloudfront distribution in aws as a CDN for better and faster distribution of the static website.
